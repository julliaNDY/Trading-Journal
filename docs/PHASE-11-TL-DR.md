3. **WS3**: Daily Bias UI (20 devs) - 6-step analysis cards
4. **WS4**: QA & Deployment (10 devs) - Testing, monitoring, deployment

**Timeline**: 2.5 weeks (Jan 20 → Feb 5)
- Week 1: Foundation (Alpaca prep, API contract, baseline)
- Week 2: Integration (Alpaca + OANDA done, AI 100%)
- Week 3: Launch (Go/No-Go Feb 4, Launch Feb 5)

## 💰 THE NUMBERS (ROI)

**Investment**: $750K (100 devs × 40h/week × 2.5 weeks × $75/hour)

**Return (Year 1)**: $794K
- 500 new premium users × $99/month × 12 months = $594K
- Retention improvement (+40%) = $200K

**ROI**: Break-even Month 11, strategic value = priceless (market leadership)

## 🚨 BIGGEST RISKS

1. **Broker Integration Delays** (30% probability)
   - **Mitigation**: Alpaca + OANDA prioritized, TopstepX as backup
2. **Team Coordination Issues** (25% probability)
   - **Mitigation**: Clear workstreams, daily standups, escalation protocol
3. **AI Quality Issues** (20% probability)
   - **Mitigation**: Extensive testing, A/B testing, fallback to OpenAI

**Overall Risk**: LOW-MEDIUM (controlled parallelization, clear dependencies)
