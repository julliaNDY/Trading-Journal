> **Decision Date**: 2026-01-17

## 📋 EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

### Decision
**Reassign Team 1C (7 devs) from POST-LAUNCH brokers to PRÉ-9 (API Contract)**

### Rationale
- TopstepX (PRÉ-4) completed before Phase 11 kickoff → Team 1C has no assigned work
- PRÉ-9 is 50% complete and blocks 50%+ of Phase 11 work
- 7 idle developers can accelerate critical path by 2 days

### Impact
- **PRÉ-9 Duration**: 4 days → **2 days** ⚡
- **Critical Path Gain**: **+2 days buffer** for Epic 12 stories
- **Launch Confidence**: 75% → **90%**
- **Risk Level**: MEDIUM → **LOW**
- **ROI**: **EXCELLENT**

### Approval
- ✅ **Recommended by**: Dev 17 (James) - Lead Broker Engineer
- ✅ **Status**: Ready for PM approval
- ✅ **Confidence**: 95%

## 🚨 RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Team 1C Unfamiliar with PRÉ-9
**Probability**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- Team 2D leads, Team 1C supports
- Brief knowledge transfer (Mon morning)
- API patterns familiar from broker work
- Clear sub-task breakdown

### Risk 2: POST-LAUNCH Brokers Delayed
**Probability**: HIGH  
**Mitigation**:
- Team 1D + 1E still assigned to PRÉ-5 + PRÉ-6
- POST-LAUNCH start unaffected
- PRÉ-5, PRÉ-6 not on critical path for Feb 5 launch
- Can slip 1-2 weeks without launch impact

### Risk 3: PRÉ-9 Takes Longer Than 2 Days
**Probability**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- 12-person team (12 devs) vs original 5 (2.4x speedup)
- Clear requirements (JSON schema design is well-understood)
- Can parallelize most work
- Fallback: still completes by original Jan 26 date

### Risk 4: Coordination Issues
**Probability**: LOW  
**Mitigation**:
- Same Slack channel (`#ws2-team-2d-contract`)
- Daily standups (10:30am WS2 sync)
- Clear task breakdown (no overlap)
- Pair programming for knowledge sharing
